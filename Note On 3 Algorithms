we were given to find the shortest path of a graph using prims algorithm technique , but there is a limitation of using this algo which is that prims only work for undirected graphs , so as we have a directed graph its not possible to find the minimum cost .
The same reason works for Krishkals algorithm as well but the codes for both prims and krushkals are attached in my repository for some undirected graph.
Now in case of Dijkistars algorithm , there is a limitation that it wont work when there is any negative weights be it an directed or an undirected graphs. hence I have attached the code for this using only positive weights.

I have choosen C language for all the algorithms.
